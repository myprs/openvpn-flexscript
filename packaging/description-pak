openvpn-flexscript is a framework to use as a user script for openvpn hooks.
OpenVPN supports user defined scripts, which can be called
on specific events in openvpn. This is an advanced scripting framework,
dealing with some of the complexity in larger deployments.
You need to extend the framework with your own functionality
by creating "plugins" (scripted in /bin/sh syntax).
